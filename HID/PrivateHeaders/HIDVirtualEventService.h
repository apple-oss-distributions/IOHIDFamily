 * The HIDVirtualServiceNotificationType enum refers to the current state of the
 * virtual service from the perspective of the clients. Specifically, these notification types establish if
 * the service is in a state where it can properly interact with clients.
 *
 * @constant HIDVirtualServiceNotificationTypeEnumerated
 * Notification on the delegate with this type indicates that service can recieve events
 * from any active clients, prior to this notification there is no guarantee events will be recieved.
 * It is possible to send events in the handler for this notification or any
 * time after until the termination notification, as the virtual service is guaranteed to be registered.
 *
 * @constant HIDVirtualServiceNotificationTypeTerminated
 * Notification on the delegate with this type indicates that the service is terminated/stale.
 * Service will need to be re-instantiated in order to be actively used by clients. It will not be
 * possible to send or recieve events in the handler for this notification; by that point
 * there will be no event system to handle events.

 * The virtual service can also interact with the HID event system by dispatching events.
