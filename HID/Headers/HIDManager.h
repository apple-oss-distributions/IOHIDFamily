 * @discussion
 * Managing multiple HID devices can be done by matching all of them and interacting
 * with them individually. To alleviate this effort, the HIDManager interface allows for
 * easily managing a pool of HIDDevices without worrying about the semantics of
 * each one. New devices that appear will automatically match and get set up using the correct
 * order of operations for the tasks performed so far, such as setting an input report handler.
 * Any action on the manager can perform the action across all the devices in the set.
 *
 * On MacOS, certain device types will require TCC approval from the user before opening the device.
