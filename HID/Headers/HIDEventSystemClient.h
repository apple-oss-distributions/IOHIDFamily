 * Enumeration of HIDEventSystemClient types.
 *
 * @field HIDEventSystemClientTypeAdmin
 * Admin client will receive blanket access to all HIDEventSystemClient API,
 * and will receive events before monitor/rate controlled clients. This client
 * type requires the entitlement 'com.apple.private.hid.client.admin', and in
 * general should not be used.
 *
 * @field HIDEventSystemClientTypeMonitor
 * Client type used for receiving HID events from the HID event system. Requires
 * the entitlement 'com.apple.private.hid.client.event-monitor'.
 *
 * @field HIDEventSystemClientTypePassive
 * Client type that does not require any entitlements, but may not receive HID
 * events. Passive clients can be used for querying/setting properties on
 * HID services.
 *
 * @field HIDEventSystemClientTypeRateControlled
 * Client type used for receiving HID events from the HID event system. This is
 * similar to the monitor client, except rate controlled clients have the
 * ability to set the report and batch interval for the services they are
 * monitoring. Requires the entitlement 'com.apple.private.hid.client.event-monitor'.
 *
 * @field HIDEventSystemClientTypeSimple
 * Public client type usable by third parties. Simple clients do not have the
 * ability to monitor events, and have a restricted set of properties which
 * they can query/set on a HID service.
