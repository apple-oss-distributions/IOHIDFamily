 * A virtual HID device.
 *
 * @discussion
 * Typically, HID devices are representations of phyiscal hardware connected to the system
 * that a user would interact with, such as a keyboard. However, there are many situations where a
 * process may want to interact with the HID event system as a HID device without human
 * interaction with physical hardware. HIDUserDevices fill this gap by allowing a process to
 * create a virtual representation of a HID device that can perform many of the actions of a
 * true HID device, such as sending input reports, receiving set and get reports, etc..
 *
 * For a process to use this interface, it must possess the com.apple.developer.hid.virtual.device
 * entitlement.
 *
 * On MacOS, certain actions will require one-time TCC approval from the user.
